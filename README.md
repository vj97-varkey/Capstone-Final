1. Overview of Problem Statement:WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) contains data of 1 subject during a stress-affect lab study, while wearing physiological and motion sensors.

Additional Information
WESAD is a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement).

2.Objective:
  To develop a model that predict the changes in the emotion of subject while wearing different types of wearables. It consist of data collected from wearables wore by subject under study.
